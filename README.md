# Kop-Heym
Architectes de Conceptions Instables

This is a little game where the player tries to get from one country to another by guessing the names of the countries in between. It only scales of Europe, but it includes both the English names of the countries and the endonyms: the name of the country in the country's most popular language. The player can turn off the ability to use the English names, and they can increase the number of guesses they get in addition to the number of countries in the shortest path.

Some of the endonyms are romanized (e.g. Rossiya), and those are spelled the way Microsoft would spell them. Kaliningrad Oblast is considered it's own thing even though it's really Russia. Kosovo is considered it's own thing because it is--the Kosovo government controls it, that makes it Kosovo. Same thing with Crimea--it's Russia because Russia controls it, even though that doesn't affect this game. Also, the game doesn't use the Celtic islands or any other isolated countries.
